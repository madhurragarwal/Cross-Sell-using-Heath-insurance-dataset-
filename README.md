# Cross-Sell Optimization with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project optimizes cross-selling of vehicle insurance using logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, and XGBoost classifier. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing enhance model performance.

## Key Components

- **Logistic Regression**: Analyzes customer data for targeted insurance recommendations.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Identifies decision paths to enhance cross-selling accuracy.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Utilizes an ensemble approach for robust predictive modeling.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Boosted decision trees for refined predictive capabilities.

## Data Processing

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis of health insurance data to uncover insights.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data for optimal model training.


## Results

Optimized cross-selling strategies based on health insights, increasing sales effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
